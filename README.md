Chocolate Duke3D
================

Chocolate Duke Nukem 3D is the equivalent of Chocolate Doom:

It is a port that:

1. Remains a true as possible to the original source code.
2. Compiles in one-click on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.
3. Aims to educate: A lot of comments and documentation have been added to help programmers to understand and learn the code.

For a discussion of Duke3D's code, [I wrote a four-part walkthrough here.](http://fabiensanglard.net/duke3d/index.php)

Cheers,

Build :
=======

Windows : Use Visual Studio 2005 or Visual Studio 2012
Mac OS X: Use Xcode 4.0
Linux   : Never tested :/ !
